Removals
========

Changes
=======

-Updated URDF
-Updated Baxter interface limb.py api with more explicit naming
-Init.sh script now supports all ros versions
-Robot enable/disable now uses rostopic interface
-Roslaunch instances have been replaced by rosrun scripts

Fixes
=====

-Fixed joystick examples to exit properly
-Fixed wobbler periodic exiting with 'failed to disable robot'
-Added numerous timeouts on state transitions (ie. robot enable, gripper calibration) and position movement validations (head position, limb joint positions).

Issues
======
                                          
-Calibration and Tare scripts will not run if there is a joint error related to the head.
Joint errors can be found in the robot monitor.

-The ROS_HOSTNAME is always set to "<robot_hostname>.local", 
which needs to be resolvable by a client machine (avahi, /etc/hosts or DNS server configuration)
